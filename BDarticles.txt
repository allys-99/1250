This was a good explanation of Data lake vs data warehouse.  It is good to read the definition
as seen through many eyes.  I didn't realize that data warehouses require special hardware also.
I thought it was just software.  Of course modern computers are faster but i assume it would 
run just slower. The article nicely explains in which case you would not need a data lake.  Also,
it seems that there are people out there that believe data lake is a bad idea and call it the 
lazy way out.  I think it's like when you have a house, a lot of stuff goes in and it only gets
cleaned out when we move out.
