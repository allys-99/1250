# Dark Data

I learned that there is another kind of Data besides Big Data, Dark Data.
We are focused on getting monetary value out of data so we take what we
need and leave the rest.  There is a place and a name for the data that is
not used or anlysed and that is Dark Data.  Apparently, 90% of collected data
is Dark Data.  The data that is not used could have hidden values as well
as legal implications.

In the case of data collected from a long time ago (maybe that's 10 years),
when technology did not exist to process the data efficiently, that old data
could find itself in a lake and be used.  For example climate change would be
a good candidate where data has been collected since 1860.  It could help to
find weather patterns over long periods of time.

# What is a data lake? Flexible big data management explained

This was a good explanation of Data lake vs data warehouse.  It is good to read the definition
as seen through many eyes.  I didn't realize that data warehouses require special hardware also.
I thought it was just software.  Of course modern computers are faster but i assume it would 
run just slower. The article nicely explains in which case you would not need a data lake.  Also,
it seems that there are people out there that believe data lake is a bad idea and call it the 
lazy way out.  I think it's like when you have a house, a lot of stuff goes in and it only gets
cleaned out when we move out.
